## Overview

This is a scheduling application targetting plant owners. It will help remind the user of their plants' basic needs, such as watering regularly and expand to allow for more detailed approach for each plant.

## Features

### Catalogue

</p>

Browse owned plants, sort them by type, most imminent need, what room they're in or simply see what needs done today.

### Suggestions and Recommendations

Each plant has different needs. Be it how much and how often it needs to be watered, what soil it's most comfortable in, or what sized pot it's best suited for at different age.

By incorporating common sense and basic botanical knowledge into the application, the user will be prompted with what's best in their given situation.

### Customizability

By personalizing each plant, we make them less forgettable. This is of course optional.

### Camera

For large sets of plants it becomes difficult to memorise which one is which. By providing a simple camera-read, hand drawn code, a la QR, we can scan away and see the plant's profile immediately.

### Rent plants

Going for holiday means leaving your plants at someone else's care. To help make this responsibility simpler, we can quickly copy over someone else's plant collection and mark them as borrowed.

### Organic approach

In the real world, watering a plant on a tight schedule, despite humidity and temperature variance wouldn't be ideal. The user must be able to easily circumvent the given schedule, and perform whatever action either pre-maturely or post-pone it.
